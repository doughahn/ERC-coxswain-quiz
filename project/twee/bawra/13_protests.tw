    <h3>Only the cox can lodge a protest</h3>
    <p>Protests must be lodged immediately by a teamâ€™s coxswain with a Race Official by VHF  radio at the end of the race, and in-person by the cox after their whaleboat has safely  docked. Protests lodged on shore by coaches will not be considered.</p>
