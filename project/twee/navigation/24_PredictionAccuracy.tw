    <h3>Not quite. Actual conditions can vary.</h3>
    <p>The actual tides along a coastline can be influenced by other factors such as weather and wind patterns, an area's topography, or river runoff. There are some places where tide predictions won't necessarily be representative of what you're actually going to see on the water.</p>
