    <h3>What if someone else was designated?</h3>
    <p>Before getting into open waters or dangerous water (really, any time) the cox should designate who will take control in the event the they are washed overboard. Rowers should be aware of who this person is so they are ready to listen to commands, and be ready for any movement through the boat this person needs to take.</p>
