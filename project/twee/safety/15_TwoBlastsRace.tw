    <h3>Not quite. Safety is more impoirtant than winningâ€¦ even against Iron Oars.</h3>
    <p>Two short blasts means it will pass you on your port side (to its starboard). If you turn to port you may have a collision. As the stand-on vessel you must maintain your heading until the boat safely passes you.</p>
