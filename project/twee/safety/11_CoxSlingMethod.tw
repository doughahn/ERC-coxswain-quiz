    <h3>Sling with Careâ€¦</h3>
    <p>First, the person is on the port side. This means port needs to grab them and Starboard needs to pull.</p> 
    <P>Fashion a sling from a docking line around the person's chest, under the armpits. The far side middle rowers pull the sling while the nearside middle rowers grab a hold of the POB (person overboard) directly. Together the four rowers pull the POB aboard.</p>
